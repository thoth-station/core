Most community activity is organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs),
time bounded Working Groups, and the [community meeting](communication/README.md#weekly-meeting).

SIGs follow these [guidelines](governance.md) although each of these groups may operate a little differently
depending on their needs and workflow.

Each group's material is in its subdirectory in this project.
