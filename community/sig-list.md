Most community activity is organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs),
time bounded Working Groups, and the [community meeting](communication/README.md#weekly-meeting).

SIGs follow these [guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md) although each of these groups may operate a little differently
depending on their needs and workflow.

Each group's material is in its subdirectory in this project.

When the need arises, a [new SIG can be created](sig-wg-lifecycle.md)
