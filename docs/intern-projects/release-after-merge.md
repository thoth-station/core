# Make a release after Pull Request merges

Assigned intern: TBA
Assigned mentor: TBA

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create an automated mechanism for making a new release after Pull Request is merged.

## Deliverables
Document of release labels that can be accepted in the PR by Kebechet.
Added mechanism in Kebechet that can recognize that PR contains any of the acceptable release label. After that, there are several approaches that can be followed. The simplest one is that the Kebechet will create a new Release Issue which is then recognized by Sesheta.
