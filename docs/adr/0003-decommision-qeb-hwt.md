Technical Story: Decommision Qeb-Hwt GitHub App

## Context and Problem Statement

[Qeb-Hwt](https://github.com/marketplace/qeb-hwt) is a GitHub Application which adds `thamos advise` based output to
Pull Requests as a check. This functionality could be integrated into https://github.com/marketplace/khebhut and
complexity and maintain costs.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* cost of maintaining Qeb-Hwt code and app
* redundancy of infrastructure

## Considered Options

* keep and maintain Qeb-Hwt
* merge function into Khebhut

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "merge function into Khebhut", because we can reduce the cost of maintaining our software infrastructure
by reducing redundancy.
